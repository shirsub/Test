#Development context of WildFly

WildFly is an open source application server in Java [2] . Its copyright is owned by Red Hat Inc. This company has a pattern of purchasing projects, releasing as open source one of the system`s functionality and then charging clients for support and access to the full feature version.

RedHat Inc has the infrastructure to turn rather small scale popular projects into a fully functional product. As stated by them: “We help more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies solve business challenges, align their IT and business strategies, and prepare for the future of technology” [1]. As much as possible RedHat Inc tries to build up their new projects on their other owned projects. This is feasible since they are “the world`s leading provider of open source solutions”[1].  

In 2006 RedHat Inc bought JBoss, and owned the copyright for the JBoss Middleware, a portfolio of enterprise-class application and integration middleware software products. [5]. One of these is The Enterprise Application Platform a single platform to quickly develop and deploy applications [4]. The application server within the JBoss Enterprise is called WildFly and released as open source.

RedHat Inc has full time employed developers that work on extending their project. However, since they are open source, some developers come from the open source community. We consider this a special environment that Rozanski and Woods did not specifically had in mind when creating the stakeholder classification. We merged some stakeholder groups and added a few new ones as shown in the classification below.

Since RedHat Inc owns and manages the development limits and direction we consider them to be both the **acquirer** and **assessors**. 
We refer to the people that voluntarily contribute to the WildFly project by submitting pull requests or providing user support by answering related questions on forums or other platforms (youtube videos, blog posts) as open source developers. We also consider the users of WildFly, and not the entire JBoss platform to be open source users. Therefore we refer to the open source community (OSCommunity) as being formed of these two groups, the open source developers and the open source users.

**Communicators & Developers**:  we merged these categories because both consist of the JBoss developers employed by RedHat Inc, represented by Jason Greene, the project leader and the OSCommunity. However any contribution made by the OSCommunity has to be approved by a JBoss developer. The primary communicator are JBoss employees, they approve the official documentation (Stuart Douglas, Brian Stansberry,Leos Literak to name a few [16]).
We have found that there is a RedHat Certificate a lot of people pride themselves with on LinkedIn. Some of them even made instructional videos on youtube[15]. Thus becoming communicators.

**Maintainers & Production Engineers(& System Administrators):** the people responsible for all these tasks are the JBoss developers employed by RedHat Inc. (like Stuart Douglas the JBoss software engineer that announced the new release). In this case the system administrators are the production engineers.

**Suppliers:** or sponsors are first of all RedHat Inc. The development made by their employees is the basis of new WildFly releases (latest version WildFly 10 on 29 January 2016). Also RedHat Inc provided other projects to help the JBoss development process which includes the development of WildFly. Some of these projects are:

- Hibernate = domain model persistence for relational databases [7]

- Narayana = transaction manager [8] 

- Infinispan = distributed in-memory key/value data store with optional schema [9]
- Arquillian = component model for integration tests that execute inside the real runtime environment [3] 

Beside the RedHat products WildFly also benefits from[17]: 

- Awestruct = framework for creating static HTML [18]

- inteliJIDEA

- ej-technologies = free JProfiler licenses

**Support Staff:** the support available for free is from the OSCommunity. However, there is payed assistance available from JBoss. Because the second one is charged we consider them a proxy. They can be considered as an alternative if the OSCommunity does not rise to the challenge.

**Testers & Users:** the testers of JBoss (that use the Aquilian platform) and the users that pay for the JBoss Platform are implicitly in the same relationship with the WildFly project. Having said that, we have testers and users exclusively for the WildFly part. They come from the OSCommunity. However there are people outside this community that need the feature WildFly offers, thus becoming exclusive users of WildFly.  We consider these categories to be in the following relationship:

<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17115270/13206067/21b9a662-d8f7-11e5-9305-493b7f271b01.jpg">
       <img style="width:15cm; "src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17115270/13206067/21b9a662-d8f7-11e5-9305-493b7f271b01.jpg" alt="Tester and User diagram">

Analyzing the environment of WildFly we feel that in order to have a comprehensive stakeholder analysis there is a need for the following categories:

**Followers:** WildFly uses social media. These followers are exclusively interested in WildFly, 3960 twitter followers and 1352 members of the google+ community. RedHat Inc has a total of 8300 employees [10]. As shown in the Power/Interest Grid for Stakeholder Prioritization this group has no power and low interest. However we consider that this group should not be monitored with minimum effort. This group is composed of employees of JBoss, people from the OSCommunity but also other people that are somehow interested in WildFly, they might not even be users. But they are potential users. These people are most likely to use WildFly. More importantly this group has the potential of becoming future JBoss employees. From the company`s perspective, this group is the first place to look for new talent that build up an interest in the product on their own.

       <img style="width:15cm; "src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17115270/13206065/21b8cc10-d8f7-11e5-98cc-1a291753240c.jpg" alt="Interest/Power Grid for WildFly">

**Competitors:** the companies that offer the same services: IBM WebSpher, Oracle WebLogic,SAP NetWeaver

**Senior Advisor:** are the people with a lot of experience in the field that can have valuable input for the success of the development process. However these people are not exclusively involved with one project. They are not always present but when they are their input is always taken into account. They are low interest but at the same time a lot of power. For WilfFly we found Arun Gupta. He is the vice president of developer advocacy at Couchbase. He has been building developer communities for 10+ years at Sun, Oracle, and Red Hat [11]. Even though he work for a different company he is interested in the project. He wrote a blog post on how to use wildfly on rasberry pie [12] and o made a youtube  tutorial [13]

**Free riders:**  This type of stakeholders are independent of the development process. They have no power but high interest. In a way they behave like a parasite. They have only to gain from the success of the project. In the case of WildFly we found Caffe Press, they sell JBoss Community Gear, cups and tshirts. The logo: "wear your open source pride" [14]

All these are summarized within the following context view:

##Wildfly Analysis
###**Issue Analysis**
Id   | Type | Summary | Reporter | Component Leading Developer
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------   
WFLY-6211 | Component Upgrade  | This issue was raised to upgrade the HAL to 2.8.19 and the priority is set to blocker. This affects the Web Console component. | Harald Pehl | Heiko Braun 
WFLY-6210 | Bug  | This issue was raised to report that the two XML config files : standalone-ha.initial.xml and standalone-ec2-ha.xml are identical. This is because the "Example ec2/gossip" server profiles do not have any modifications from the standard HA profiles (missing proper discovery protocols). The priority is set to Blocker and this affects the Build System component. | Radoslav Husar | Paul Gier
WFLY-6208 | Bug  | This issue was raised to report a new warning on shutdown "Error updating cluster member list: org.infinispan.remoting.RemoteException: ISPN000217: Received exception from node2". The priority is set to Major and this affects the Clustering component. | Radoslav Husar | Paul Ferraro
WFLY-6162 | Task  | This issue was raised to add a test variant with the setting OPTIMISTIC locking to -DextendedTests in the test suite. The priority is set to minor and this affects the Clustering and the Test Suite components. | Radoslav Husar | Paul Ferraro (Clustering) and Jason Greene (Test Suite)
WFLY-6096 | Feature Request  | The request was raised to make the changes made by the installation of Infinispan 8.1 to be non-default. These changes are not uniform and cause a reduction in the data integrity guarantee for databases that default to row locking on modified rows. The priority is set to major and this affects the Clustering component.  | Stephen Fikes | Paul Ferraro
WFLY-6183 | Bug  | The issue affect the server of the system. Moreover, the system is working under Windows server 2008 R2 enviroment. The http/https listener does not start after the server is started. There is no any indication for an error in the log files. This bug requires from the users to re-install the entire wildfly to initiate the http/https listener. This issue was reported and solved at the same time, this is an indication that the issue has high priority and is vital for the stakeholders, since this bug affect a major functionality of the system. | Krishna Ramaiah | Jason Greene
WFLY-6157 | Bug  | The current version of the system was unable to initiate a stable connection with a SQL Server datasource when using Wildfly with JDBC driver. However, this configuration was sufficient for previous versions. The error was in connection class configurations. The issue was resolved after a period of two days, which indicates that the issue was not extremely vital.| Jason Greene  | Jason Greene 
WFLY-6099 | Bug  | After the creation of a datasource through application.xml and the connection in persistence.xml, the deployment of the EAR file failed due to the fact that the datasource is called before its creation. The problem was in a deprecate xml file. However the issue is classified with major functionality since the issue was affect a vital functionality of the system(JPA/Hibenate). | Scott Marlow  | Scott Marlow 
WFLY-6094 | Component Upgrade  | This issue is an upgrade of an existing component (Clustering). This upgrade was occurred after a request from the users. This issue was assigned with major priority since is a component upgrade to please several stakeholders and it is connected with an open pull request on Git Hub. | Paul Ferraro  | Paul Ferraro 
WFLY-6032 | Feature Request  | This is an issue that states a request from a user. The requests were to display in console for the particular server instance that is having a stuck thread issue and to report this in the server log file. |Jason Greene | Jason Greene

##Results
###Overall Activity 
The process for a pull request consisits of several steps:  
Clone repository -> Create Branch -> Change Code -> Pass 3 Checks -> Wait for merge  
Furthermore, the majority of the pull requests focuses on a specifique issue, by changing only couple of files.  Moreover, the developers focus on resolving bugs(Issue type). Furthermore, all of the sumbitted pull request have to be checked by passing three tests. After that,  the leading developer will decide wheaver a pull request will be merged or not.

###Analytics
Description  | Result 
---- |  ----
Open pull requests | 85
Closed pull requests | 8573
Merged pull request ratio | 2.57 per day
Proposed pull request ratio | 1.4 per day
Contributors | 248

For the past 30 days, 155 new issued were created and 123 resolved. The majority of the of created issues, refer to a bug, and therefore the most of them were resolved instandly (see Figure 1).

##**Git Analysis Conclusions**

From the analysis we conduct on both pull requests and issues, we found out that the Stakeholders which are involved are the Developers. The Developer class, could be further divided in leading developer(for each component of the system), common developer and Open source community. Each one in this category, has different abilities. The leading developer is responsible to review the code of pull requests and to decide which pull request is going to be merged or not. The common contributors(of the system) are responsible to resolve different issues (e.g bugs, feature upgrades, feature requests) and the open source community developers can assist to resolve open issues by submitting pull requests. 

The Integrators, as described by Georgios Gousios in [LINK],  in this project are the different component leads. On average they recieve 1.4 pull requests everyday and they have to decide which requests to merge. They make merge decisions based on the quality of code, the style and if it fits the project's roadmap. If a pull request is not merged the integrators usually send a brief explanation or provide a log file. High priority issues are resolved immediately such as major bugs and low priority issues wait in the queue such as minor feature requests.

##**Contact steps**
The developer discussions mailing list can be used to contact the developers of Wildfly (wildfly-dev@lists.jboss.org). For more specific enquiries we can contact the component leads directly.
